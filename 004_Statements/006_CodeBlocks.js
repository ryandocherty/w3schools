//----------JavaScript Code Blocks----------

//JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}
//The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together
//In this tutorial we use 2 spaces of indentation for code blocks


//One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:

function codeBlocks_Function(){
    document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
    document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = "How are you?";
}
