//----------JavaScript White Space----------


//JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable
//The following lines are equivalent:
let person = "Hege";
let person1="Hege";

//A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):
let x = y + z;
