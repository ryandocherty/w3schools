//JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

//For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters
//If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:


function lineBreaks_Function(){
    document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = 
    "Line Breaks!";
}
