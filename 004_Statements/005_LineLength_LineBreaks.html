    JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

    For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters
    If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>
        The best place to break a code line is after an operator or a comma.
    </p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
            "Hello Dolly!";
    </script>

</body>

</html>
