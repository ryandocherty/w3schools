<!-- 
    Semicolons ;

    Semicolons separate JavaScript statements
    Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.</p>

    <p id="demo1"></p>

    <script>
        let a, b, c;
        a = 5;
        b = 6;
        c = a + b;
        
        //When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
        //a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
        
        document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = c;
    </script>

</body>

</html>


<!-- 
    On the web, you might see examples without semicolons
    Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended
