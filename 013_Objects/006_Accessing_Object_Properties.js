//----Object Properties----


//The 'named value's, in JavaScript objects, are called 'properties'.

//PROPERTY	        VALUE
//firstName 	    John
///lastName 	    Doe
//age 	            50
//eyeColor 	        blue


//Objects written as name value pairs are similar to:
//Associative arrays in PHP
//Dictionaries in Python
//Hash tables in C
//Hash maps in Java
//Hashes in Ruby and Perl




//----Accessing Object Properties----


//You can access object properties in two ways:

//objectName.propertyName
//objectName["propertyName"]

const personObject5 = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

personObject5.lastName;
personObject5["lastName"];
