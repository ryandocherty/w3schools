//----Objects Are King----


//In JavaScript, Objects are King
//If you Understand Objects, you Understand JavaScript.

//'Objects' are containers for 'Properties' and 'Methods'.
//'Properties' are named 'Values'.
//'Methods' are 'Functions' stored as 'Properties'.
//'Properties' can be primitive values, functions, or even other objects.


//In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

//Objects are objects
//Maths are objects
//Functions are objects
//Dates are objects
//Arrays are objects
//Maps are objects
//Sets are objects
